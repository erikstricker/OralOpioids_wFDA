Description: Provides details such as Morphine Equivalent Dose (MED), 
    brand name and opioid content which are calculated of all oral opioids 
    authorized for sale by Health Canada and the FDA based on their Drug Identification Number (DIN) or National Drug Code (NDC). 
    MEDs are calculated based on recommendations by Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) and Von Korff et al (2008)
    and information obtained from Health Canada's Drug Product Database's monthly data dump or FDA Daily database for Canadian and US databases respectively.
