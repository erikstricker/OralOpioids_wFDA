## Description

Provides details such as Morphine Equivalent Dose (MED), brand name and
opioid content which are calculated of all oral opioids authorized for
sale by Health Canada based on their Drug Identification Number (DIN) or
FDA based on their Product ID for Opioids authorized for sale in
Canadian or US markets. For US Opioids, MEDs are calculated using Von
Korff et al. (2008) and information obtained from FDA’s daily National
Drug Code Directory \[/drug/ndc\] download MEDs are calculated based on
recommendations by Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) and
information obtained from Health Canada’s Drug Product Database’s
monthly data dump for Canadian Opioids. Please note in no way should
output from this package be a substitute for medical advise.  
All medications should only be consumed on prescription from a licensed
healthcare provider
